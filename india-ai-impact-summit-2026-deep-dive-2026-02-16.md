The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is a five-day mega-event (Feb 16-20) at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, drawing 20+ heads of state, 250,000+ expected visitors, 3,250+ speakers across 700+ sessions, and 600+ startups across 70,000 sq. metres of exhibition space. Organized by MeitY and NASSCOM under the IndiaAI Mission, it is the first global AI summit hosted in the Global South and the largest AI gathering by attendee count to date.

The summit has already produced several headline outcomes: Anthropic announced its first India office in Bengaluru; Blackstone led a $1.2B investment in Indian AI compute startup Neysa; AMD and TCS unveiled a partnership for rack-scale AI infrastructure ("Helios"); PM Modi invited the world's data to "reside in India" with a tax holiday extending to 2047; and 12 indigenous Indian foundation models were showcased, including BharatGen's 17B-parameter Param2 and Sarvam AI's voice-first models for 22 Indian languages. Sam Altman confirmed India is OpenAI's second-largest market (100M+ weekly active users), and the Indian government released its AI Governance Guidelines anchored in seven sutras with a principle-driven "innovation over restraint" philosophy.

## Findings

### 1. Major Global Tech Companies & What They're Showcasing

The summit attracted the CEOs and presidents of nearly every major AI company on the planet. Here is what each is presenting or announcing:

**OpenAI** — Sam Altman described India as a potential "full-stack AI leader" and confirmed India is OpenAI's second-largest market with 100M+ weekly active ChatGPT users and the largest student user base globally. He outlined a three-part framework (Access, Adoption, Agency) and pushed for "Democratic AI." OpenAI opened its first India office in Delhi in August 2025. ([BusinessToday](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/ahead-of-india-ai-summit-2026-sam-altman-backs-india-as-a-future-full-stack-ai-leader-signals-deeper-collaboration-516183-2026-02-15), [ANI](https://aninews.in/news/world/asia/openai-ceo-sam-altman-pushes-for-democratic-ai-in-india-says-will-announce-expansion-and-govt-partnerships20260215122101/))

**Anthropic** — Dario Amodei is headlining sessions on AI safety and governance. The headline announcement: Anthropic is opening its first India office in Bengaluru (second Asian base after Tokyo). India is Anthropic's second-biggest Claude user base after the US, and the office will hire for engineering, go-to-market, and policy roles.

**Google / Alphabet / DeepMind** — Sundar Pichai (CEO, Alphabet) and Demis Hassabis (CEO, DeepMind) are headlining sessions on the future of work and ethics of sentient-like models. Google is part of a combined $68B commitment (with Microsoft and Amazon) to AI and cloud infrastructure in India through 2030. Google specifically committed Rs 1.25 lakh crore for a 1 GW AI hub in Vizag. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/india-ai-impact-summit-tech-ceos-new-delhi.html))

TCS subsidiary HyperVault AI Data Center Limited will deploy AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs, EPYC "Venice" CPUs, Pensando Vulcano NICs, and the open ROCm software ecosystem. Blueprint scales to 200 MW data centres. ([AMD Newsroom](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-2-15-amd-and-tcs-to-bring-state-of-the-art-helios-rac.html), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-16/amd-takes-on-nvidia-in-india-with-expanded-tata-ai-partnership))

## Survival Tips (from Day 1 Attendees)

Based on real social media reports from Feb 16 ([BusinessToday](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/story/massive-crowds-no-upi-patchy-internet-netizens-flag-mismanagement-at-ai-impact-summit-2026-516355-2026-02-16), [BusinessToday](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/story/day-1-of-ai-impact-summit-founders-call-out-overcrowding-missing-prototypes-at-flagship-event-516373-2026-02-16)):

1. **Arrive before 9 AM** — Multi-hour queues reported later in the day
2. **Carry cash** — UPI and digital payments failed on Day 1 due to patchy internet
3. **Download everything offline** — Mobile internet barely worked inside the venue
4. **Expect VIP disruptions** — PM Modi's Day 1 visit caused midday hall evacuation for security
5. **Enter via Gate 4** (shuttle services), Gate 7, or Gate 10
6. **Use golf carts** — The 70,000 sq. m venue is enormous
7. **Bring water and snacks** — Food counters were overwhelmed on Day 1 (Swiggy/Zepto kiosks available)
8. **Plan your chakra route** — With 10 arenas and 300+ pavilions, aimless wandering wastes hours
9. **Use the India AI Impact Summit mobile app** for QR-based entry and real-time schedule
10. **Have backup meeting locations** outside venue in case of security-related shutdowns

## Key Takeaways

1. **India's $100B+ AI infrastructure play is real:** Between the $68B combined Big Tech commitment (Google/Microsoft/Amazon), $18B in semiconductor projects, $1.2B IndiaAI Mission, $1.2B Blackstone-Neysa deal, and $1.1B state VC fund, India is building the physical backbone for a sovereign AI ecosystem at unprecedented scale.

2. **Voice-first, multilingual AI is the next frontier:** Sarvam AI, BharatGen, Gnani AI, and others are building models that work in 22+ Indian languages and prioritize voice interaction. The next billion AI users will interact via voice, not text — any AI product targeting India or the Global South must account for this.

3. **Global AI governance is fragmenting:** India's 7-sutra "innovation over restraint" framework deliberately differs from the EU AI Act's precautionary approach and the US executive order framework. Companies operating across markets will need to synthesize and comply with multiple, divergent regulatory regimes.

4. **India is now the #2 market for both OpenAI and Anthropic:** With 100M+ weekly ChatGPT users and India as Anthropic's second-largest Claude user base, the subcontinent has gone from "emerging AI market" to "critical AI market" in under 18 months. Both companies opened India offices.

5. **For summit visitors (Feb 17-20):** Arrive before 9 AM, carry cash (UPI unreliable), download materials offline, plan your chakra route in advance, and expect VIP-related security disruptions. The Startup Pavilion, Jio AI Pavilion, French Pavilion, and AI Immersive Theatre are the four must-see destinations regardless of persona.

*Research compiled: February 17, 2026. The summit runs through February 20 — major announcements including President Macron's keynote and the final summit declaration are expected Feb 19-20. This report covers Days 1-2 findings and will need updating as the event progresses.*

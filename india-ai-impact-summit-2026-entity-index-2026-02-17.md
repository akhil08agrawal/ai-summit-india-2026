# India AI Impact Summit 2026 — Entity Index, Venue Map & Event Guide

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Research type:** event coverage + entity index
**Preset:** thorough
**Context:** Complementary to the Companies, Launches & Visitor Guide report — focuses on maximum entity-level data, venue map details, and event schedules
**Builds on:** india-ai-impact-summit-2026-deep-dive-2026-02-16.md

## Executive Summary

This report is the data-heavy companion to our Feb 16 deep dive on the India AI Impact Summit 2026. Where the prior report covered announcements, policy, and persona-based visitor recommendations, this report targets three specific information gaps: (1) venue layout and booth locations, (2) day-by-day event schedules with times and speakers, and (3) a comprehensive entity index of every named company, startup, and institution at the summit.

Key findings: We identified all 12 IndiaAI Mission foundation model developers (previously only 7 were known), confirmed booth/hall locations for 6 exhibitors across Halls 1-5 and Hall 14, assembled a day-by-day schedule covering 40+ named sessions with exact times and speakers, and indexed 90+ entities with company profiles. The summit uses 7 exhibition halls (Halls 1-6, Hall 14) across Bharat Mandapam, with sessions also at Sushma Swaraj Bhawan (startups/students), Ambedkar Bhavan (policy/governance), India Habitat Centre (education), and UN House (ODET side events).

## Key Takeaways

1. **The 12 IndiaAI Mission model developers are now fully mapped.** The newly identified 5 (Soket AI Labs, Gan AI, GenLoop, ZenteiQ Aitech, Shodh AI) reveal India's indigenous AI ambitions extend beyond multilingual LLMs into materials science (Shodh, ZenteiQ), video generation (Gan AI), and defence applications (Soket). ZenteiQ's Rs 206 crore allocation makes it the single largest IndiaAI Mission recipient among startups.

2. **Venue navigation requires strategic planning.** With 7 exhibition halls spread across double-storied buildings, golf carts for transport, and only 3 entry gates with different operating hours, visitors should arrive before 9 AM via Gate 10 (metro) or Gate 4 (shuttle). The official app is essential — the full floor plan is behind the portal and not publicly available.

3. **Feb 19 is the single most important day.** All major headliner sessions (Pichai, Altman, Amodei, Hassabis, Brad Smith), the Leaders' Plenary with 20+ heads of state, Macron's keynote, and the CEO Roundtable where Modi meets 35-40 corporate leaders all happen on Wednesday Feb 19. Plan to arrive at opening (9:30 AM) and expect maximum security.

4. **The USISPF delegation is larger than reported.** With 120+ senior executives co-chaired by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam, and an AI Task Force chaired by John Chambers, this is a significant US-India business engagement beyond the headline tech CEO appearances. Several newly identified attendees (Mistral AI's Mensch, Accenture's Sweet, Ericsson's Ekholm, Vertiv's Albertazzi) were not in our prior report.

5. **Challenge finalists represent genuine global participation.** MalariaX from Thailand (age 13-15) building malaria detection, Gooey AI from the US building multilingual orchestration, and Happykids AI from Luxembourg building student wellbeing tools — the 70 finalists from 60+ countries show this summit's impact challenges attracted serious international applicants, not just Indian teams.

*Research compiled: February 17, 2026. The summit runs through February 20. Major announcements including President Macron's keynote, the Leaders' Declaration, and the GPAI Council outcomes are expected Feb 19-20. This entity index will need updating as new exhibitor and session data becomes available.*
